			<h2 align="center" >TECHNOLOGY WORLD </h2>
			<p class ="info">Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals, especially in a reproducible way.[1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2][3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.

			Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.

			While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides.</p>

			<h3>HOCKEY MATCH: </h3>
			<p class="info">Hockey Test series: Lack of goals from forwards remains an issue as India lose fourth consecutive game to Australia
			One of those positives is that for the third time in four matches, India had a lead to protect but for the third straight match they let it slip

			If your glass is half full, you could say the Indian men’s hockey team put up their best performance yet on the tour of Perth. If your glass is half empty, you could say Australia continue to be India’s kryptonite, a mystical force that keeps hitting them where it hurts.

			Pragmatically, performances are all that matters at this stage of the season, knowing where the team stands as they look to head to the Paris Olympics and match or better the bronze from Tokyo. But at some point, the habit of losing repeatedly to an opponent who are in the same pool is bound to leave some scars.

	<p class="info-business"><b>HAL gets Rs 65K cr MoD tender for 97 more Tejas Mark 1A fighter jets : </b>
		In what could be the government’s largest-ever purchase of indigenously-built military equipment, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has issued Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) a request for proposal (RfP) for 97 Tejas Mark 1A fighter aircraft.

		A HAL spokesperson has confirmed that the defence public-sector undertaking (DPSU) has been given three months to respond to the MoD’s RfP with a detailed proposal.
 
 		HAL is close to completing an earlier MoD order for 40 Tejas Mark 1 fighters (two squadrons). Following that, the MoD placed an order in February 2021 for 83 Tejas Mark 1A fighters (four squadrons) worth Rs 45,700 crore. The six Tejas squadrons already ordered will now be supplemented by five squadrons (97 Tejas Mark 1A), taking the number of indigenous Tejas fighters to 11 squadrons.

 		This multi-role capability is further enhanced by the Tejas’ multi-mode airborne radar, helmet-mounted display system, a self-protection suite and a laser designation pod.
		
		The Tejas is built to be an inherently unstable fighter. It has a sophisticated quadruplex flight control system that allows its pilots carefree handling and enhanced manoeuvrability. The issue of the Tejas RfP improves visibility on HAL’s order inflow and long-term execution.
